# Airgead Banking Compound Interest App (C++)

## Overview
This C++ console application helps users understand the power of compound interest by calculating investment growth over time. It displays yearly balances and earned interest both **with** and **without** monthly deposits.

## Problem Being Solved
The program solves the problem of showing how an initial investment grows under compound interest, and how consistent monthly contributions can significantly change long-term outcomes. It provides a clear year-by-year breakdown to support financial literacy.

## Features
- User input for initial investment, monthly deposit, annual interest rate, and number of years
- Year-by-year report of ending balance and interest earned
- Output comparisons:
  - Without monthly deposits
  - With monthly deposits
- Clean formatting and consistent numeric output

## How to Run
1. Compile and run the program in your C++ environment (Visual Studio recommended).
2. Enter the requested values when prompted.
3. Review the generated yearly reports.
